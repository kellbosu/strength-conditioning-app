# 💪 Strength & Conditioning App

A full-stack **strength and conditioning platform** built with **Python**, **React**, and **MongoDB**.  
This app generates structured training waves (10s, 8s, 5s, 3s), calculates percentages based on user maxes, and tracks long-term performance trends.

---

## 💡 Overview

This app automates classic strength programming by combining:
- **Smart training wave generation** using configurable templates (`SCHEMES`)
- **Dynamic calculation** of weights and reps from user max data
- **Persistent storage** with MongoDB
- **Interactive frontend** built in React for managing workouts and tracking results

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Backend | **Python / Flask (or FastAPI)** | API + business logic |
| Frontend | **React.js** | User interface |
| Database | **MongoDB** | Stores user data, maxes, and history |
| Other | JSON, REST, Modular Architecture | Configurable waves, clean separation of logic |

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🏋️ Auto-generates training waves (10s, 8s, 5s, 3s)
- 🔢 Calculates lift weights and rep schemes dynamically
- 📊 Tracks progress and stores results in MongoDB
- ⚙️ Modular, data-driven architecture using Python dicts for configuration
- 🌐 React-based frontend for real-time user interaction

---

## 🧱 Future Plans

- ✅ CLI prototype for testing (Python-only)
- 🔜 REST API with Flask or FastAPI
- 🔜 MongoDB workout history tracking
- 🔜 React dashboard with charts (PRs, weekly volume, etc.)
- 🔜 Authentication (JWT or OAuth)
- 🔜 Mobile-responsive design

## 🚀 Getting Started

IN PROGRESS
